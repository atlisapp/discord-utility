    ðŸŒŒ Equinox ðŸŒŒ
</h1>
Equinox is a multi-purpose Discord bot meant to satisfy your needs.

This bot contains tons of configuration options and a wide spectrum of features - even an AI chatbot (using Cleverbot)!

Equinox is not only easy to setup and comes "out of the box", but it is also quite fun to play with. Most of the reviews are often
commenting on how good it is as well, so you know you're in for a treat!
